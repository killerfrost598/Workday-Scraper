Python code to extract Job posting information from Workday websites

## How to Run

**Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/killerfrost598/Workday-Scraper.git
```

Install the Selenium Python package:

  ```bash
  pip install selenium
  ```

Ensure you have Chrome browser installed on your desktop.

Run the main file:

you get the outputs in the output folder once extraction is finished.

Note: It only works on windows due to the parallel processing to reduce the extraction time.

Reduce the processes count in main.py if you have less cores.
